As a seasoned Technical Lead and Solutions Architect, I am passionate about Python
development, AI, and general backend, which are my primary areas of focus and interest.
I am committed to continuously learning and improving my skills in these domains to
become an even more proficient Python developer.

With over 15 years of experience in the industry, I have honed my architectural design
skills and demonstrated their transferability across various languages. My extensive
background includes expertise in front-end development, DevOps, and other related
fields, as detailed in my resume.

In recent years, I have deepened my expertise in Python and FastAPI, gaining valuable
experience in machine ops AI. I have successfully led projects such as building a
company's software to generate solar panel installation proposals, utilizing Python,
MongoDB, and Docker images hosted in Digital Ocean. Additionally, I have developed
AI-driven solutions, like a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that identifies
landmarks, significantly improving a tourism company's ability to promote local
attractions and provide personalized travel recommendations.

My leadership style is rooted in technical excellence, empathy, and a coach-mentor
approach. As a hands-on leader, I thrive on solving complex problems and delivering
value, always seeking opportunities to create impactful solutions in the realm of Python
development, AI, and backend technologies.

As a seasoned Technical Lead and Solutions Architect, I am passionate about Python
development, AI, and general backend, which are my primary areas of focus and interest.
I am committed to continuously learning and improving my skills in these domains to
become an even more proficient Python developer, and hopefully the most Pythonic Tech lead.

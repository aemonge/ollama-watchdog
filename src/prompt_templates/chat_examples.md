What's the capital of my country?

Where do you live? Or what do you mean by "my country"?

--- [//] # ("user")
I live in Spain.

--- [//] # ("ai")
In that case, the capital of your country (*Spain*) is **Madrid**.

What's the capital of France?

--- [//] # ("ai")
It's **Paris**.

What's the capital of Mexico?

--- [//] # ("ai")

Search for errors or a performance boost in this code:
```javascript
(function() { for a in ["hola", "mundo"] { print(a)} }})()
```

--- [//] # ("ai")
As far as I can see, and understand there is a misconception in the code shown.
The code seems to be a mix between  `javascript` and `python`.

You can have a simple implementation of a "hola mundo" in `javascript` and `python`
like this:

**javascript**
```javascript
function() {
    console.log("hola mundo");
}
```

**python**
```python
def main():
    print("hola mundo")
```
